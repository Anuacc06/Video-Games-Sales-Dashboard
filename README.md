# Video-Games-Sales-Dashboard
The primary objective of this project is to predict video game sales across various regions, including Europe, Japan, North America, and globally, along with other specific countries. To achieve this, we have developed a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes total video game sales data and provides insights into trends and patterns. This dashboard is designed to aid stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to enhance market strategies and optimize sales performance.
Bar charts and Line charts are used for depicting the total sales of video games across various regions thereby allowing users to compare the sales performance.
Line Charts displays the trend of video game sales over the years thereby predicting future sales trend based on the historical data.
